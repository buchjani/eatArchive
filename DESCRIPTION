Description: Provides tools to automate the archiving of directory contents using open, software-agnostic file formats. The package supports scanning nested directories, copying files into a new folder structure, and converting selected formats (e.g., XLSX to CSV, DOCX to PDF/A). Each step is documented in a machine-readable log (CSV), recording source paths, destination paths, and any format conversions applied.
