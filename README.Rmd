# eatArchive

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of eatArchive is to automate the archiving of directory contents using open, software-agnostic file formats. The package supports scanning nested directories, copying files into a new folder structure, and converting selected formats (e.g., XLSX to CSV, DOCX to PDF/A). Each step is documented in a machine-readable log (CSV), containing the source paths, destination paths, and any format conversions applied. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of eatArchive like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Workflow

This is a schematic representation of the workflow, consisting of three major steps: 

1. R function `write_metadata()` for generating an excel file documenting the contents of a directory  
2. selecting files for archive, by specifying their archival subdirectory in the excel file 
3. R function `create_archive()` for reading the excel file, copying and converting files from the original directory to the archival directory

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
