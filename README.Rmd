eatArchive helps you automate the archiving of directory contents using open, software-agnostic file formats. The package supports scanning nested directories, copying files into a new folder structure, and converting selected formats (e.g., XLSX to CSV, DOCX to PDF/A). Each step is documented in a machine-readable CSV log that records source paths, destination paths, and any format conversions applied.


## Installation

You can install the development version of eatArchive from Github with

``` r
remotes::install_github("buchjani/eatArchive")
```

## Workflow

This is a schematic representation of the workflow, consisting of three major steps: 

1. R function `write_metadata()` for generating an excel file documenting the contents of a directory  
2. selecting files for archive, by specifying their archival subdirectory in the excel file 
3. R function `create_archive()` for reading the excel file, copying and converting files from the original directory to the archival directory

Please note: `create_archive()` is currently under construction but will be available soon.
